# Nova: Types rules

In Nova programming language, we have 6 main data types:
signed integer: i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, 1256 \
unsigned integer: u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, u256\
float: f16, f32, f64, f128, f256\
(NOTE: You can costume your float variables with minimum and max values, like -1 to 1 or -4 to 4)

defining variables:
using let, you declare a mutable variable, you may specify what type is it
let i: i16 = 5;
and if you dont change the variable at all, you will have a Warning.
using const, you declare a immutable variable
const i = 50;
print(i); //it's alright since you don't change it.
//i += 5; it's ERROR
