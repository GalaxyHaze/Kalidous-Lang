# Nova: Types rules

In Nova programming language, we have 6 main data types:
>signed integer: i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, 1256 \
>unsigned integer: u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, u256\
> float: f16, f32, f64, f128, f256\
>(NOTE: You can costume your float variables with minimum and max values, like -1 to 1 or -4 to 4)

defining variables:
>using let, you declare a mutable variable, you may specify what type is it
> >let i: i16 = 5;
using const, you declare a immutable variable
> >const i
